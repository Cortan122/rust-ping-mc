# rust-ping-mc
A small rust program to ping a minecraft server, and save the status to a txt file.

This is my first time using rust, so i'm sorry to anyone who has to read this.

The build folder is 100MB, because rust. yay...

## build and run

Running:
```console
$ cargo run
$ cat status.txt
```

Building and coping the executable:
```console
$ cargo build --release
$ cp target/release/rust-ping-mc .
```
